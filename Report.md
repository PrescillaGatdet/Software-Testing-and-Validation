## Introduction

Personal financial management has become increasingly important as individuals seek better control over their income, expenses, and savings. Many people struggle to track where their money goes, leading to overspending and difficulty achieving financial goals. A budget management system addresses this need by providing users with tools to record transactions, organize them into categories, and view summaries that reveal spending patterns.

The Budget Management System developed in this project allows users to input income and expenses, assign transactions to predefined categories, and generate reports summarizing their financial activity. The system is built using a modular architecture that separates data handling, business logic, and user interface components, making it well-suited for applying structured software testing methodologies.
Software testing is critical for financial applications because calculation errors or data handling bugs could cause users to misunderstand their financial situation. A budget tool that displays incorrect totals or loses transaction data would fail its fundamental purpose. This project applies software testing and validation principles including test planning, test case design, validation techniques, and defect tracking to ensure the system performs correctly and reliably.

The following sections describe the problem definition and design requirements in Section 2, present alternative solutions and the final chosen approach in Section 3, document team collaboration and meetings in Section 4, outline the project schedule in Section 5, and conclude with a summary of achievements and recommendations for future work in Section 6.

## Problem Definition

Managing personal or organizational finances effectively is a challenging task due to the complexity of tracking income, expenses, savings, and financial goals. Many individuals and small organizations rely on manual methods such as spreadsheets or handwritten records, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack real-time insights. These traditional approaches make it difficult to monitor spending patterns, control unnecessary expenses, and make informed financial decisions.

Additionally, the absence of automated categorization, budgeting alerts, and analytical reports often leads to poor financial planning and budget overruns. Users also face difficulties in maintaining historical financial data securely and accessing it conveniently when needed.

Therefore, there is a need for a Budget Management System that provides a centralized, user-friendly, and secure platform to record income and expenses, categorize transactions, set budgets, track spending, and generate meaningful financial reports. Such a system would help users gain better control over their finances, improve financial discipline, and support informed decision-making.

Individuals often lack visibility into their spending habits, making it difficult to manage finances effectively and achieve savings goals. Without a structured system to record and categorize transactions, users may lose track of expenses, overspend in certain categories, or fail to identify areas where they could reduce costs. Manual tracking methods such as spreadsheets are error-prone and time-consuming, while many existing budgeting applications are either too complex or lack the reliability users need to trust their financial data.
The goal of this project is to develop a Budget Management System that enables users to track income and expenses, categorize transactions, and generate accurate budget summaries and reports. The system must be thoroughly tested and validated to ensure that all financial calculations are correct, data is stored and retrieved reliably, input validation prevents invalid entries, and reports accurately reflect the user's financial activity.
From a software testing perspective, the problem is to design and execute a comprehensive test strategy that verifies the system's functionality, accuracy, and robustness. This includes creating test cases that cover normal operations, boundary conditions, and error scenarios, as well as tracking and resolving any defects discovered during testing. The testing effort must demonstrate that the Budget Management System meets its requirements and can be trusted to provide users with accurate financial information.
