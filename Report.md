## Project Definition

Managing personal or organizational finances effectively is a challenging task due to the complexity of tracking income, expenses, savings, and financial goals. Many individuals and small organizations rely on manual methods such as spreadsheets or handwritten records, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack real-time insights. These traditional approaches make it difficult to monitor spending patterns, control unnecessary expenses, and make informed financial decisions.
Additionally, the absence of automated categorization, budgeting alerts, and analytical reports often leads to poor financial planning and budget overruns. Users also face difficulties in maintaining historical financial data securely and accessing it conveniently when needed.
Therefore, there is a need for a Budget Management System that provides a centralized, user-friendly, and secure platform to record income and expenses, categorize transactions, set budgets, track spending, and generate meaningful financial reports. Such a system would help users gain better control over their finances, improve financial discipline, and support informed decision-making.
